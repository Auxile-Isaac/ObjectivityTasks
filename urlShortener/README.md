here's an explanation of each function in the URL shortener implementation:

  1 .generateShortURL(longURL): This function takes a long URL as input, generates a unique hash code for it using the hashCode function, and returns a short URL that incorporates the hash code. It also stores the short URL and corresponding long URL pair in a urlMap object for later retrieval.

  2 .getLongURL(shortURL): This function takes a short URL as input and retrieves the corresponding long URL from the urlMap object. This can be used to redirect the user to the original long URL when they access the short URL.

  3. hashCode(str): This is a helper function that generates a hash code for a given string. It uses a simple algorithm to combine the ASCII values of each character in the string, resulting in a unique hash code for that string. The resulting hash code is converted to a base-36 string to ensure that it can be used in a URL.

  The generateShortURL and getLongURL functions work together to create a mapping between short URLs and long URLs. When a long URL is passed to generateShortURL, it generates a short URL and stores it in the urlMap object along with the corresponding long URL. When a user accesses the short URL, getLongURL retrieves the corresponding long URL from the urlMap object and redirects the user to that URL.

  Note that this is a simple implementation and does not include any error handling or security measures. In a production system, you would need to add additional functionality to handle errors, validate inputs, and prevent malicious users from exploiting the system.
