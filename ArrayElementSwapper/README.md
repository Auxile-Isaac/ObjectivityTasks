  This function first checks if the given indices are valid (i.e., if they are non-negative and within the bounds of the array). If the indices are invalid, it throws an error.

  Assuming the indices are valid, the function swaps the elements at the given indices by storing one of the elements in a temporary variable (temp), then replacing that element with the other element, and finally replacing the other element with the temporary variable. This effectively swaps the elements at the given indices.

  Finally, the function returns the modified array with the swapped elements.
